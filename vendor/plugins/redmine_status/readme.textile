h1. Redmine Status Updates

This is a plugin for "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org that allows users to create small status updates about what they're currently working on.  You can think of it as "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com on a per-project basis, within Redmine.

h2. Installing

Simply follow the instructions found on the "Redmine Wiki":http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.  One caveat is that the plugin expect to find a stylesheet under the directory <notextile>REDMINE_DIR/plugin_assets/redmine_status/...</notextile> so either name the plugin directory redmine_status or rename the folder generated after you start up your server from whatever you named it to redmine_status.

h2. Usage

Enable the "Statuses" module on the project settings page.  From there on out, usage should be fairly obvious.  Create new status updates by clicking the "Update your status" link on the "Status Updates" page.  Oh, and also, enjoy!
